I am passionate about learning how systems work, how attacks happen, and how to defend organizations from cyber threats.

My goals:
- Become a SOC Analyst or Cybersecurity Specialist  
- Build strong technical skills in Linux, Python, SIEM tools, and network defense  
- Gain hands-on experience in detecting, analyzing, and responding to security incidents  

Cybersecurity motivates me because it gives me the ability to protect systems, help people stay safe, and continuously learn new technologies.
